## Contents

- **HW1:**  
  - Self-supervised image classification with BYOL
  - Semantic segmentation with VGG16-FCN32s and ResNet50-DeepLabV3  
  - Applied Meta's SAM for segmentation masks  

- **HW2:**  
  - Conditional diffusion models (DDPM) on MNIST-M and SVHN  
  - DDIM sampling with different Î· and latent interpolations  
  - Personalization with CLIP zero-shot classification and multi-concept diffusion  

- **HW3:**  
  - Zero-shot image captioning with LLaVA  
  - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) for image captioning  
  - Attention map visualization for image-text alignment  

- **HW4:**  
  - 3D Gaussian Splatting for real-time radiance field rendering  
  - Comparison with NeRF (efficiency vs. quality trade-offs)  
  - Adaptive density control, initialization strategies, and performance metrics  

- **Final Project:**  
  - Multimodal perception and comprehension of corner cases in autonomous driving (ECCV 2024 Challenge)
